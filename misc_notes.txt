# test scenarios

1) vary the chunk size in urlopen.read() to see how it impacts download time

file size   chunk size (x * 1024)   time            memory (ps -auxww, vsz col)
5.5 mb      16                      4.2 sec
5.5 mb      64                      2.5 sec
5.5 mb      128                     2.5 sec
818 mb      128                     3 min 43 sec
818 mb      1024                    3 min 44 sec
818 mb      64                      3 min 43 sec    85 mb

In the 800mb test, it was maxing out at my ISP's download speed (32 mbps or 4 mBps)
for a 800 mb file / 4 mBps = 200 sec or 3 min 20 sec

2) determine the max amount of time it takes to download to decide the max amount
of time to allow the lambda to run.  Need to test it on lamdba to see the AWS max
download speed

3) determine memory size for lambda

4) upload speed (from a local file to s3)

file size   method          time (total run time, include download)
818 mb      s3.Object.put   22 min 4 sec, maxed out my ISP upload bandwidth

Also test s3.Object.upload_file
http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Object.upload_file

5) test the 800 mb file by directly reading from the URL and upload to a s3 bucket
without using a temporary file

config memory (mb)  max execution time      status  completion time     memory used (mb)
128                 5 min                   failed  90 sec              128
1024                5 min                   succ    68 sec              90
256                 5 min                   succ    63                  97
